## About <a name = "about"></a>

Tanu is a platform for writers to publish their stories. It is built with React, Node, and MongoDB. It is a work in progress. The project is currently in development.

**Tanu** means _Stories_ and this project is about creating a self-hostable publishing service for stories by independent authors, including the ability to read chaptered books online, and provide the ability for readers to download formatted eBooks.

Our objective is to allow users to write stories in plain text, Markdown, ${\TeX}$, ${\LaTeX}$, or other formats, and to allow the server to render those files into attractive rendered eBooks for users' browsers.

Each **Tanu** library is unique -- requiring its own login credentials -- and offers members of that library access to Like, Bookmark, Commenting, Tagging, and Subscription options.
